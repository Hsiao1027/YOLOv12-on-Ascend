# YOLOv12-on-Ascend
set up npu env for yolo series model (Ultralytics)

## Overview

This repository develops the **Ascend Extension for PyTorch** named **torch_npu** to adapt **Ascend NPU** to **PyTorch** so that developers who use the **PyTorch** can obtain powerful compute capabilities of **Ascend AI Processors**.

Ascend is a full-stack AI computing infrastructure for industry applications and services based on Huawei Ascend processors and software. For more information about Ascend, see [Ascend Community](https://www.hiascend.com/en/).
