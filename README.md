# YOLOv12-on-Ascend
set up npu env for yolo series model (Ultralytics)

## Overview

This repository provides a PyTorch-based implementation and training setup for YOLO series models on Huawei Ascend NPUs using the torch_npu extension. By leveraging the compute power of Ascend AI Processors, developers can train object detection models such as YOLOv12 efficiently within the Ascend ecosystem.

Ascend is a full-stack AI computing infrastructure for industry applications and services based on Huawei Ascend processors and software. For more information about Ascend, see [Ascend Community](https://www.hiascend.com/en/).
